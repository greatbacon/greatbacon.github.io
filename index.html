    <p>The Shadows Institute was founded as an experimental space for implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_production">peer production</a> models for horror fiction.</p>
    
    <p>We seek to take back the power of the pen & purse from the ruthless suits that ruin creative pursuits and put it back in the hands of the creators.</p>

    <p>Our primary publication is currently a quarterly zine, "Shadows of the Rocky Mountains", which focuses on small horror stories set in and around the area.</p>

    <p>The "Shadows of the Rocky Mountains" archive can be found <a href="archive/sotrm/index.html">here.</a></p>

    <p>To stay up to date on the project, you can sign up for our newsletter <a href="https://theshadowsinstitute.substack.com/subscribe" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <p>If you want to support the project, we have a Kofi and are accepting donations <a href="https://ko-fi.com/theshadowsinstitute">here.</a></p>

    <p>The Institute is currently run and edited by the Temporary Benevolent Editor, Corvus van Roodland. </p>
